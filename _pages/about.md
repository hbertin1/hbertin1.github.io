I'm a Ph.D. student at the [IRISA](https://www.irisa.fr/) research center at the [University of Rennes](https://www.univ-rennes.fr/), France, under the supervision of Prof. David Bromberg (University of Rennes) and Prof. Marc Dacier (KAUST). I'm part of the [Wide](https://team.inria.fr/wide/) research team.

I am interested in security concerns related to distributed systems and more specifically in multiplayer online games systems. My research focus is on cheating detection, with an emphasis on network-level attacks. 

Before that, I was a visiting student within the [Serber](https://serber.kaust.edu.sa/) research group at KAUST, Saudi Arabia.
